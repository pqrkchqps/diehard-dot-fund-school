# Starting your group

Getting started is often the hardest part of anything. On Diehard.Fund, it involves getting everyone signed up, familiar with the tool, and comfortable making decisions together. If done well, the group will come to life as people take the initiative to start discussions and raise proposals.

Most Diehard.Fund groups need a champion to help them get going, and then they build their own momentum. If you're reading this, that champion is probably you!

## Introduce Diehard.Fund 👂👄🗣

Have a discussion with your group about using Diehard.Fund.

- **What problem** are you trying to solve with a new tool? (For example, including people who can't attend meetings, better documentation, or to keep making progress between meetings.)
- **What kind of decisions** do you want to make on Diehard.Fund?
- **Who's involved?** Does everyone in the group need to use it?
- What kind of **behaviour** is welcome, and what's not ok?
- How will Diehard.Fund complement your **existing processes**?

Some people will be apprehensive about adopting a new piece of software for online decision-making. Talk to people in your group to work through any concerns.

## Have a look around 👀

You need a good understanding of how to use Diehard.Fund, so you can assist others.

Make sure you understand the [group settings](https://manual.diehard.fund/en/group_settings.html), especially privacy. Have a look through the menus and sections to familiarise yourself with the software.

## Update your group description 🌟

With a clear purpose, people can make judgement calls about what's best for the group. Understanding group context helps people get oriented.

Your Diehard.Fund group page has a space for information. Update this field so that everyone can see it when they visit the group. If you're unsure, start a discussion with your group about what you want to achieve together and what information people want on the group page.

## Upload a profile photo 👩🏽

Seeing someone's face next to the text they've written can make it feel more human. It's especially important if you're the one welcoming everyone in.

Upload your profile photo before sending invitations to join the group, so that your friendly image is included.



## Upload a group photo 🖼

Uploading a photo that has some meaning to your group significantly improves the sense of belonging. You can customise both the small square photo (eg, with a logo), and the big cover image (eg, with a group photo).

## Introductions thread 👋🏽

A round of introductions is a great way for people to get to know a bit about each other and to feel more comfortable. Even if people are already acquainted, they can share more specifically about their role or perspective in the Diehard.Fund group.

New groups start with an introductions thread automatically. We recommend you edit the thread to make it yours, with a prompt relevant to your group.

To edit the introductions thread, click into it and select the edit option in the context box.

## Invite people 🙋

You're ready to invite people into the group! Diehard.Fund is a group collaboration tool, so this is an important step.

Visit your group page and click the “Invite people” button.

* If you have their email addresses, you can send invitations to each member of your group.
* Or you can share the invitation link via email or however your team communicates.

Follow up on people who don't make it into the group and give them a nudge. You don't want to leave people out of decision-making.

If people join but don't introduce themselves, you might like to welcome them to the group with an @mention in the introductions thread:

> “Welcome to the group @Jane :) It's great to have you here! Would you saying a little bit about your work in this space?”

## Champion the use of Diehard.Fund 🏆

### Demonstrate and invite participation.

If you model behaviour for others  to emulate, your group will be more inclusive and engaging. You can help decisions progress constructively.

For example:

> - “@Jane that could be a good idea, why don’t you raise a proposal so we can see if the rest of the group agrees?”
- “We haven’t heard from @Bill and @Ngaire … what are your thoughts?”
- “We might be getting off topic here. I've started another Diehard.Fund discussion about that [here](http://www.diehard.fund). Let's bring this back to the original focus.”

### Move decisions to Diehard.Fund

#### If discussions are happening via email...
Remind the group you've agreeed to use Diehard.Fund and request people move the discussion over there. Sometimes it can be helpful to copy and past what's been said so far and directly give everyone the Diehard.Fund link.

#### If decisions are being made in-person...
Recall why you wanted to use Diehard.Fund, and ask if the group wants to move the discussion online before concluding a decision. Common reasons are to include people who aren't in the room, and create documentation for future reference.
