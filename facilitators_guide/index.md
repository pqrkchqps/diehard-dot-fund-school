# The Diehard.Fund Facilitation Guide üê∫

 **What if we started from facilitation principles and worked toward understanding software? This guide goes in-depth about applying key facilitation concepts in the online space.**

Diehard.Fund is made by facilitators, and that plays a huge role in how it has been designed. This guide is about revealing more of that context, and translating facilitation concepts from the offline space to the online space.

## More about this guide

Whether employed by a professional facilitator, people peer-facilitating each other, or a group that has no awareness of facilitation at all, Diehard.Fund‚Äôs essential function is to mediate and support group communication toward a desired outcome. In other words, facilitation.

Diehard.Fund is *groupware*:

> Collaborative software, or groupware, is designed to help people involved in a common task achieve their goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is ‚Äúintentional group processes plus software to support them.‚Äù -- Wikipedia


There is a huge body of knowledge, best practice, and tradition in both in-person facilitation and online moderation, but the art and science of their intersection is only just emerging. This is the specific space where Diehard.Fund strives to excel.

## About the author

Hi! I'm Alanna.

<img src="alanna_fringe_s.jpg" alt="Alanna" class="img-left img-200px"/>

I'm one of the founders of Diehard.Fund, and I've been thinking deeply about how it works from a facilitation perspective since the beginning. I am not a seminal facilitation expert; I consider myself only a beginner in this craft that one could spend a lifetime honing.

What I can offer is help translating between the offline and online spaces, as a practitioner in both. I've facilitated a lot of groups who use Diehard.Fund, and learned from their experiences.

You can find out [more about me on my website](http://alanna.space).

I'm only one person, with one perspective and approach to facilitation, when there are myriad approaches. I've tried to bring in a couple other facilitator's voices here, including [Rich](http://richdecibels.com/) from Diehard.Fund and Silvia from [EXP](http://exp.agency).
