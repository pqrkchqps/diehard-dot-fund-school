MEETINGS AND DECISION MAKING
4.1 We agree to listen to the person who is speaking and respect the opinions and emotions of all members of the group. We aim to create a space in meetings where all ideas, concerns, fears and dreams can be expressed and are equally honoured and respected.


4.2 Decision-making is by the agreed process outlined below. All significant decisions must be passed using The Village Loomio Group.


To make a group decision, anyone can raise a proposal, which should be open for at least 2 weeks to give people time to participate.


We use the following four voting options:
agree — “I’m happy with this”
disagree — “I think we can do better, but I will go along with the group if they think it is best”
abstain — “I’m happy for the group to decide without me”
block — “I cannot support this decision. This proposal would jeopardise my membership in the group.”


A proposal passes if:
there are no blocks AND
at least 75% of people participate AND
we have made a reasonable* effort to resolve any “No” votes AND
at least 75% of participants have said “Yes”


*Reasonable: If a member votes no, they must give a reason for it and it must be discussed at the next meeting or resolved beforehand.

4.3 If a proposal is not passed, a new proposal should be created to address the concerns raised.


4.4 If someone blocks a proposal, it is their responsibility to come up with an alternative, do research and meet with other members individually or in small groups, to build consensus so that we can revisit the decision at the next monthly meeting. All new information must be supplied at least a week before the meeting to give people time to consider it.


4.5 Some decisions require 100% agreement and 100% participation, e.g. purchasing land, approving documents such as this one.


4.6 A member absent from a meeting is expected to read the meeting minutes and may request to revisit an agenda item at the next meeting. Members not present at a meeting are still expected to participate in the online decision-making process via Loomio.


4.7 Past decisions can only be reopened at a meeting, by the agreement of 50% of members.
